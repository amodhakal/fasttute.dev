Stop scrubbing. Start learning.

Fastiture transforms passive YouTube tutorials into active, efficient learning environments. It's a tool built to fix the broken experience of learning complex technical topics from video.

## The Pain

Learning from technical YouTube videos is fundamentally inefficient. The workflow consists of:

- Endlessly scrubbing back and forth to find a specific concept.
- Constantly pausing and manually typing out code from the video player.
- Losing context and having no way to search for information within the video.
- Forgetting which video contained that one crucial explanation you now need.

This is a waste of time and a massive barrier to effective learning.

## The Solution

Fastiture is a web application that takes a YouTube URL and generates an interactive, AI-powered learning session. It provides:

- **A time-synced transcript** that lets you read along and click to jump to any point in the video.
- **AI-generated chapter markers** that structure the video and make navigation effortless.
- **AI-extracted code blocks** that you can copy with a single click.
- **A personal, searchable library** to save, organize, and revisit the content that matters to you.
